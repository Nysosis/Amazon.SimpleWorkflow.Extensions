Each task will fall into one of two categories:\r\n* __Activity task__ - for doing actual work, e.g. processing an order, taking data from one location to another\r\n* __Decision task__ - for deciding what's the next step in the workflow given its current state\r\n\r\nTasks are distributed to _'workers'_ with polling, and like Simple Queuing Service (SQS), each task can be received by one worker at a time and the worker has certain amount of time to complete the task and responds with a completion message or the task will be timed out (and can be retried up to some configured number of times). For long running activity tasks, the worker might also need to record periodic __heartbeats__, or the task might be marked as failed or timed out.\r\n\r\nEvery step of a workflow execution is recorded in SWF and you can retrieve the __full history of events__ that had occurred during a workflow either programmatically or via the Amazon Management Console.\r\n\r\nYou can also easily terminate or rerun a workflow with a few button clicks in the Amazon Management Console, should you choose to.\r\n\r\n###Project Goal\r\nThe standard Amazon SDK provides a [AWS Flow Framework](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/awsflowguide/welcome.html), but it's only available for Java.\r\n\r\nThe facilities provided by the .Net SDK is a straight mapping to the [actions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/apireference/Welcome.html) available on the SWF service. Using these actions alone, it's cumbersome to build any sort of useful process out of SWF because you need to take care of a lot of plumbing yourself, including:\r\n* handle task polling\r\n* handle exceptions (and retries) when polling tasks\r\n* differentiate different types of tasks\r\n* record heartbeats periodically\r\n* respond completed message on successful completion\r\n* respond failed message on exceptions during processing of a task\r\n* ...\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to provide a framework that allows you to design and implement a workflow using SWF with as little friction in the development process as possible.\r\n\r\n###Example usages\r\nCheck out the [Wiki](https://github.com/theburningmonk/Amazon.SimpleWorkflow.Extensions/wiki) page for a list of examples.\r\n\r\nI also have a series of introductory posts on how to use the library to model workflows:\r\n- [High Level Overview](http://theburningmonk.com/2013/02/making-amazon-simpleworkflow-simpler-to-work-with/)\r\n- [Part 1 - Hello World] (http://theburningmonk.com/2013/02/introduction-to-aws-simpleworkflow-extensions-part-1-hello-world-example/)\r\n- [Part 2 - Beyond Hello World] (http://theburningmonk.com/2013/02/introduction-to-aws-simpleworkflow-extensions-part-2-beyond-hello-world/)\r\n- [Part 3 - Parallelizing activities] (http://theburningmonk.com/2013/02/introduction-to-aws-simpleworkflow-extensions-part-3-parallelizing-activities/)\r\n- Part 4 - Child Workflows (coming soon)\r\n- Part 5 - Retries (coming soon)\r\n\r\n###Nuget\r\nDownload and install using [NuGet](https://nuget.org/packages/Amazon.SimpleWorkflow.Extensions).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://nuget.org/packages/Amazon.SimpleWorkflow.Extensions\"><img src=\"http://theburningmonk.com/images/swf-extension-nuget-install.png\" alt=\"NuGet package\"/></a>\r\n\r\nYou can view the full release notes [here](https://github.com/theburningmonk/Amazon.SimpleWorkflow.Extensions/wiki/Release-Notes).\r\n\r\n###Keep in touch\r\nPlease follow the official twitter account [@swf_extensions](https://twitter.com/swf_extensions) for updates, and feel free to send me any feedbacks or questions you have about the project :-)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
